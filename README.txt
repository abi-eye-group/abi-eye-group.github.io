If you want to scale your display correctly you will need to fill in "Display Options". 

You may notice motion artefacts (e.g., comet tails) that degrade the clarity of the stimulus.  This is typical for LED monitors. 
If this is the case for you, and you would like a higher quality experience you could check-out Blur Busters (https://blurbusters.com/faq/motion-blur-reduction/) for more information on combatting this problem.

Our own solution has been to use nVidia's Ultra Low Motion Blur (ULMB) technology, which requires an appropriate nVidia graphics card and a ULMB capable monitor. This works. 
We have also used a 120Hz AMOLED Tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra) which works as well.
